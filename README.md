An end-to-end data engineering pipeline that orchestrates data ingestion, processing, and storage using Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. All components are containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

This project serves as a step-by-step guide to building a complete data engineering pipeline, covering everything from data ingestion to processing and storage. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Data Ingestion with Apache Airflow**:
   - **Task Orchestration**: Apache Airflow is used to manage and schedule tasks in the pipeline. It fetches random user data from the `randomuser.me` API and stores it in a PostgreSQL database.
   - **Ease of Use**: Airflow makes it easy to set up and monitor complex workflows, ensuring data is ingested reliably.

2. **Real-Time Data Streaming with Apache Kafka**:
   - **High-Throughput Streaming**: Apache Kafka streams the data from PostgreSQL to the data processing engine. It handles large volumes of data efficiently and ensures that the data flows smoothly through the pipeline.
   - **Coordination with Zookeeper**: Apache Zookeeper manages Kafka brokers, providing distributed synchronization and ensuring the system is fault-tolerant.

3. **Data Processing with Apache Spark**:
   - **Scalable Processing**: Apache Spark processes the streamed data, performing transformations and aggregations as needed. Spark's distributed computing capabilities allow it to handle large datasets and complex computations efficiently.
   - **Master and Worker Nodes**: Spark's architecture, with master and worker nodes, ensures that the processing tasks are distributed and managed effectively.

4. **Data Storage with Cassandra**:
   - **High Availability Storage**: The processed data is stored in a Cassandra database. Cassandra is chosen for its high availability and scalability, making it suitable for storing large volumes of processed data.
   - **Fast Data Retrieval**: Cassandra provides fast read and write capabilities, ensuring that the stored data can be accessed quickly for analysis and reporting.
